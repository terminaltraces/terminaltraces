# Hello, I'm Drew (she/her/hers)!
_Engineer, writer, artist and maker of things_

I'm currently a front end engineer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com), building awesome stuff on the Enterprise team (like the [Site Activity log](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/site-activity-log) and [Page Branching](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/page-branching))!  Prior to that, I worked at [Rover.com](https://rover.com) on the New Business Lines team, and [T-Mobile](https://tmobile.com) building internal tool UIs for router deployment.  

Prior to that, I was in school working on my [Master of Science](https://epublications.marquette.edu/theses_open/256/) and [Doctoral](https://epublications.marquette.edu/dissertations_mu/836/) degrees - I got to be a part of some [pretty cool projects](https://epublications.marquette.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname:%22Williams%22%20author_fname:%22Drew%22&start=0&context=507519&facet=), like [building the Fred Sammons Archives](https://fredsammons.org/)!

My major interests are accessible user interfaces :accessibility: and inclusive design of software and websites. It's important to build something that everyone could use, without assuming that their background will be a certain way! ðŸŒž

My most-used technologies are...
* React
* Javascript (especially with Flow typing)
* Python (and Django)
* NodeJS
* Angular

I'm currently learning...
* Typescript
* NextJS

When I'm not building cool stuff in React, I'm hanging out with my family, designing new bullet journal layouts, writing short fiction, or drawing.
